# Week 4 Lab Report

## Introduction

In Week 3, we worked with Github in committing and pushing various small changes
to practice **incremental development**.  In total, three different 
failure-inducing input markdown files were used to detect shortcomings of the
original file we were provided with.  After analyzing the symptoms and 
determining the bug, we reworked our code to work with the new files while ensuring compatibility with
other markdown files.  Below is a record of three bugs that were fixed.

## First Bug
