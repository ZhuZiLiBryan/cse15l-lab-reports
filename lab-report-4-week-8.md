To test each snippet for both my repo and the other groups repo, I wrote and
appended the following tests for each snippet for each repo, resulting in six
tests in total:

## Testing Snippet 1

### Expected Outcome:

Based on the preview in VSCode, the expected outcome is as follows:

![pic_4](Images/report4/pic_4.png)

Thus a list of links should include:  _`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu_

### Code Used to Test:

![pic_5](Images/report4/pic_5.png)

### JUnit Outputs:

My code resulted in a failure:
![pic_7](Images/report4/pic_7.png)

The other repo also resulted in a failure:
![pic_6](Images/report4/pic_6.png)
